# Hello World! by Polkadot
Gitcoin has integrated Polkadot and Kusama tokens (DOT and KSM) into its tech stack, making them one of the first full integrations outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.

To celebrate the integration on Gitcoin, we are organising Hello World! by Polkadot, a series of challenges to bring you on a journey of Polkadot development discovery.

Check out the kick-off webinar for more details and information.

## Challenges and prizes
The challenges are in four categories: (1) Beginner, (2) Intermediate, (3) Advanced, and (4) Ecosystem. The first three are written specifically for Polkadot and Kusama, whereas the Ecosystem category is made up of challenges created by Polkadot ecosystem projects. Challenge payouts are capped at 50, meaning that only the first fifty valid submissions will receive a payout.

Challenge	#	Prize	Cap
Beginner	7	3 DOT	50
Intermediate	5	1 KSM	50
Advanced	4	10 DOT	50
Ecosystem	8	5 DOT	50
In addition, there is an EXTRA PRIZE of 150 DOT for the first 50 that manage to complete 18 or more challenges.
Everyone successfully solving any challenge and receiving a payout will also get an awesome piece of Polkadot swag as well as a Kusama-based NFT, issued via RMRK.
